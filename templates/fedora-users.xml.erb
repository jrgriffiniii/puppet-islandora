<!--File to hold drupal connection info for the FilterDrupal servlet filter. For multisite drupal installs you can include multiple
connection elements.  We will query all the databases and assume any user in any drupal db with the same username and password are the same
user.  We will gather all roles for that user from all databases.  This is a potential security risk if a user in one drupal db has the same
username and password as another user in a separate drupaldb.  We are also assuming all drupal dbs to be mysql.  This file should be located
in the same directory as the fedora.cfcg file-->
